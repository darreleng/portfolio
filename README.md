# Portfolio
This repository is a compilation of projects as I explore the world of data science!

## [Project 1 - Telco Churn Analysis](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/telco_churn.ipynb)
I identify the main factors that are associated with customer churn using a mix of statistical tests (T and Chi2) and a random forest machine learning model (CatBoost), and analyse their implications and what the telco can do to improve customer retention.

## [Project 2 - Brand Perceptual Map](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/brand_perception.ipynb)
I create a brand perceptual map using PCA and a biplot.

## [Project 3 - Sales Prediction](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/supermarketsales_catboost.ipynb)
I clean and explore a sales dataset before feature engineering and forecasting sales.

## [Project 4 - Stroke Predictions](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/stroke_predictions.ipynb)
Similar to the sales prediction project, but classification.

## [Project 5 - Energy Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/energy_anomaly_detection.ipynb)
I try to detect meter reading anomalies in 2 buildings using traditional machine learning models and an LSTM neural network.

## [Project 6 - Henry Thia vs. Khaw Boon Wan Classifier](https://github.com/darreleng/portfolio/blob/main/thia_khaw_classification.ipynb)
There is a running joke in Singapore that actor Henry Thia and former politician Khaw Boon Wan are doppelg√§ngers. In the first half of this project, I evaluate the accuracy of a semi-supervised K-means model. In the second half, I first build a simple convolutional neural network to establish a baseline accuracy score. From there, I try to improve its score through data augmentation and transfer learning using an EfficientNet model.
